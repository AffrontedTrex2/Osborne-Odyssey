Mr.Osborne,
You are like code that compiles correctly, without any repeats.
If the average person had the brain compacity could be represented as an int, yours could only be expressed by a long.
My love for you is neverending, like a program with the time complexity O(2^N).
Your head shines so bright, even our computers set to the highest setting cannot compete.
All my feelings for you, even a mergesort could not sort them fast enough.
You are like the left curly brace to my right curly brace.
There is no semicolon for my respect for you.
Your superiority reigns over us like a parent class.
We are lucky to be able to implement your infinite wisdom.
You're so unique, there will never be another instance of you.
In a PriorityQueue, you will always be first to me.
If my admiration were expressed by a while loop, it would never break.

Mr.Osborne, you are like StackOverflow, always there for me.
God bless,
Jasmine, Clarissa
